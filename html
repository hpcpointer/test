          <h4>Spirit Week Interview:</h4>
          <p><strong>We sat with Ms. Wanichko to talk about this year's spirit week.</strong></p>
          <div class="qa">
            <p><strong><span class="question">Q:</span></strong> What are your thoughts on spirit week? Positive, negative, etc?</p>
            <p><strong><span class="answer">A:</span></strong> So far, I think it's going pretty good. It's only Monday, but I do feel like a lot of people are in all black fits or kinda that grunge look. The themes for this week are very popular and liked, so there should be high participation.</p>

            <p><strong><span class="question">Q:</span></strong> How does this year’s spirit week compare to last year’s?</p>
            <p><strong><span class="answer">A:</span></strong> I think there’s more trendy themes. It goes with what is popular online and within the generation of kids that we have. I think it's trendy.</p>
